## Snowmobiling

There will be three departure points. Please let us know which one you prefer.

The departures will be from:
- Icelandair Hotel Marina &mdash; 8:00am
- Harpa conference hall &mdash; 8:10am
- 22 Hill Hotel &mdash; 8:15am

### What to bring:
- Warm clothes, you are going on a glacier. You will be provided with an overall, helmet, gloves and boots.
- Sunglasses. If you don't have a pair with you, we recommend going to Tiger at Laugavegur 13. You can get cheap sunglasses there for less then 10 euros/dollars.
- A bottle of water.

Note that there are two on each snowmobile. The ride is 1 hour long. Arrival at the base camp on Langjökull Glacier is expected to be at noon. There you will put on the gear provided by the operator.

You will arrive back in Reykjavik half an hour before leaving for the Blue Lagoon, giving you enough time to go to your hotel and fetch your swim suit. You will be taking the second bus to the Blue Lagoon party.

The departure is either from *Icelandair hotel marina* or *Harpa conference hall*. Please let us know which one you prefer.

Also, let us know if you would prefer to snorkel in a wet suit. Bear in mind that the lake/fissure is 3&deg;C.
