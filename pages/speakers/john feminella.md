    <p>Blockchains are a new kind of data structure with many interesting applications, and are perhaps most notable for their use in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. In this talk, weâ€™ll explore what a blockchain is, where and how you might use them (and when you shouldn't, despite what the hype might tell you!), and show how we might build our own in JS.</p>
