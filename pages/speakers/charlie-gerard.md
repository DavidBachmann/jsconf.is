<p>A typical interaction with a device or interface involves touching it. Either you’re pressing buttons on a controller, swiping on a touchscreen or clicking on your laptop’s trackpad. But what if you could control things without the use of your hands? What if you could use… your thoughts?</p><p>I have been tinkering with a brain sensor for about a year and developed an open-source JavaScript framework for it to allow me (or anyone else) to control interfaces or robots using only mental commands or facial expressions.</p>
