The Apple Macintosh was released 32 years ago and had 128KB of RAM. We managed to let you drawing to the screen using Canvas APIs, using npm packages, and much more by writing fully ECMAScript 5.1 compliant code with half of that memory. In this talk, Iâ€™d like to present our learnings from porting the JerryScript engine to the Pebble smartwatch to empower JS lovers to develop for wearable consumer electronics. From engine internals over embedded hacks to JavaScript inception where we cross-compile the JS engine itself to JS using Emscripten to produce JS bytecode inside any JS environment: Expect some craziness.
