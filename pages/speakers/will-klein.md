<p>Testing our JavaScript apps has come a long way. For years we relied on Selenium Webdriver to automate browser testing from outside the browser. Now we can use tools like Cypress to interact from the same JavaScript runtime as our app, without relying on remote APIs, language bindings, or browser-specific drivers.</p><p>Let's explore how Cypress created a new testing platform to enable an awesome developer experience. This includes "native" debugging and time travel capabilities. We'll walkthrough using Cypress and how it all works, so we can deliver better, well-tested software.</p>
