<p>We've all been impressed by the likes of <em>Siri</em>, <em>Google Now</em>, and <em>Cortana</em>, for understanding our spoken words, but is it possible to take advantage of the powerful speech recognition behind such services on the web? This talk will explore the <strong>Web Speech API</strong> and how it can empower web apps for improved <em>accessibility</em> and new ways of <em>user interaction</em>.</p>
