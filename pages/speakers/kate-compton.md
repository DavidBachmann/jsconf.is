<p>Can you write a program to create art? Code can create procedural content for games, but it can also create 3D printable objects, patterns for fabric, or Twitterbots that post code-created comic strips. Kate has produced all of these and more (and is known for outreach and education about generativity) and will demonstrate practical techniques behind generating emergent surprising and artistic worlds with Javascript, Canvas, and SVG.</p>
