<p>Node.js has been around for 9 years now, so you might think we’re getting closer to holding a finished piece of software in our hands. Yet somehow, despite placing a high value on stability, it is seeing a record number of commits and new contributors.</p><p>With the Node 10.0.0 release just around the corner, it’s worth taking a closer look at what has been changing and where Node.js is headed: HTTP/2 support, ES Modules, N-API, async_hooks and a Promise-based standard library are just some of the upcoming gems that this talk will put in the spotlight.</p>
