<p>At Netflix, we run Node servers at scale for our website, TV and mobile devicesâ€™ UI data API services. In this talk, I will share our journey of how we migrated from data API service monolith to well isolated micro services running in Node Docker containers. Using Docker containers and tooling infrastructure, we provide a Node.js platform as a service, making debugging, testing and deployment easy to perform. Every software releases can be consistently reproduced across the stack. UI engineers can focus on developing core business logic to be more productive.</p>
