<p>A talk about the architecture of the Spotify Desktop application, which is currently based on Web technologies. How we organize our teams, war stories and lessons learned during our development process.</p>
<p>This is not a talk about one specific framework or tool, but about how we work with JavaScript in an environment that is a bit different from most web-based apps, the experiences we've had and some ideas that can be useful and applicable in different contexts.</p>
