We are thrilled to announce the date and venue for the first JSConf Iceland:

**AUG 25-26**

That's a Thursday and Friday. Just after your vacation, right before you get too busy with work. Perfect for catching up on awesome talks and with friends from the JavaScript community. Afterwards, you can extend the trip over the weekend to experience the wonder of Iceland.

Speaking of wonder, the venue is a looker:

HARPA, Reykjavik

Harpa is one of Reykjavik's greatest and most distinguished landmarks. This grand-scale, award-winning architecture offers some of the best facilities for conferences in Northern Europe.

The location is also great. Harpa is in the heart of the city and features stunning views of the surrounding mountains and the North Atlantic Ocean. Most of the best hotels, restaurants and pubs in Reykjavik are in walking distance.

## What now?

The first batch of early bird tickets will go on sale next week. We'll send another update just before that, launching the website and call for speakers as well.
