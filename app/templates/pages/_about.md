For the first time, JSConf is coming to Iceland.

A two day international conference set in August 25-26. That's a Thursday and Friday. Just after your vacation, right before you get too busy with work. Perfect for catching up on awesome talks and with friends from the JavaScript community.

There are two awesome tracks over two days with over 30 talks total.

The Hekla track is a curated set of speakers that have [submitted proposals](/callforspeakers) and made it through the selection process.

The Geysir track is driven by people like you! It has a unique format pioneered by JSConf US where anyone can register to speak in a first-come, first-speaking format. These talks cover a huge range and are some of the most exciting talks at JSConf.

But that's only the start. JSConf is all about the community. That means connecting with people between talks, hacking in the lounge, communal dining, partying and crawling pubs together. For those that extend their stay we'll have community trips on Saturday 27th to experience the wonder of Iceland.

Treat yourself to the one-of-a-kind gathering, vacation and experience of JSConf Iceland.
