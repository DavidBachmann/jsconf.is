JSConf is coming to Iceland August 25<sup>th</sup> â€” 26<sup>th</sup>.

That's a Thursday and Friday. Just after your vacation, right before you get too busy with work. Perfect for catching up on awesome talks and with friends from the JavaScript community.

Expect two awesome tracks over two days with over 30 talks in total.

The **Hekla track** is a curated set of speakers that have [submitted proposals](/speakers) and made it through the selection process.

The **Katla track** is 50% curated, 50% featuring people like *you*! In a unique format pioneered by JSConf US, anyone can register to speak in a first-come, first-speak format. These talks cover a huge range and are some of the most exciting talks at JSConf.

But that's only the start. JSConf is all about the **community** - connecting with people between talks, hacking in the lounge, communal dining, partying and crawling pubs together. Extend your stay over the weekend and experience the wonders of Iceland.

It's sure to be a one-of-a-kind gathering, vacation and adventure.
