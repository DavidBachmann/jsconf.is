## Reykjavik, Iceland

Come and be inspired.

Reykjavik is a vibrant city filled with warm, hospitable people. It has a small-scale urban center that is easy to navigate. The hassle-free city center is clean, safe and packed with restaurants, shopping, culture and vibrant nightlife. Enjoy meeting the friendly locals, who speak English as their second language (and often other Scandinavian and European languages).
