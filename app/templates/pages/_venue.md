# Reykjavik, Iceland

Come and be inspired.

Reykjavik is a vibrant city filled with warm, hospitable people. It has a small-scale urban center that is easy to navigate. The hassle-free city center is clean, safe and packed with restaurants, shopping, culture and vibrant nightlife. Enjoy meeting the friendly locals, who speak English as their second language (and often other Scandinavian and European languages).

Iceland is a great place to experience gorgeous, incredibly varied, untouched nature. Drive just 30 minutes outside Reykjavik and you'll enter a whole different world, full of wonders including The Blue Lagoon, Geysir and Þingvellir. Driving further you´ll find huge waterfalls, "alien" landscape, active volcanoes, glaciers and much more. Iceland's unique color palette and landscapes can't be found anywhere else in the world.

# The Venue

**Harpa** is one of Reykjavik's greatest and most distinguished landmarks. Opened 2011, this grand-scale, award-winning piece of architecture has some of the best conference facilities in Northern Europe.

The location is also great. Harpa is in the heart of the city and features stunning views of the surrounding mountains and the North Atlantic Ocean. Most of the best hotels, restaurants and pubs in Reykjavik are within walking distance.

# Getting to JSConf Iceland

Iceland is perfectly situated midway between the USA and Europe with only 3 hours flight from Europe and 5 hours flight from USA.

A lot of airliners fly to Iceland. We recommend Icelandair for a fairly priced ticket with good service and a local flavor. If you're located in California, WOW air offers a non-stop ticket from SFO and LAX to Iceland.
