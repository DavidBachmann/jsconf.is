We are inviting the JavaScript community to submit talks for JSConf Iceland. Call for Presentation **closes April 30th**.

If you think you have something great to talk about, tell us all about it. If you know someone who has something great to talk about, nominate them.

[Suggest a speaker](https://svef.typeform.com/to/I1Wv9R)

## Topics

We like to see anything that fits into the spectrum of:

 * Cutting-edge technological advances in the world of JavaScript or computer science in general, if somehow applicable to JavaScript
 * Wild Ideas & Clever Hacks
 * Improving JavaScript developers’ lives
 * Whatever the hell you want, this is your conference

## The Perks

If you get selected as a speaker, here’s what you get:

 * Travel to Reykjavik
 * Conference ticket
 * Hotel and food

If you want to bring a significant other, or bring your kid(s) and need child-care to be sorted out for the time of the conference, please get in touch. We are here to make this easy for you!

<small>If your employer can cover your travel and hotel, we are happy to list them as an company sponsor. The money we save will be used to make the conference more awesome.</small>

## We Can Help

Not everybody is a natural talent on stage. Not everybody can produce kick-ass slide-decks. Not everybody is a live-demo god.

There are about a million reasons why *you* don’t consider yourself a speaker. **We are here to prove you wrong**. We are here to help you to develop or hone the skills you need to deliver a great presentation.

* We can connect you with experienced speakers to help prepare your submission.
* We can review and give advice on your slide deck. If you're not feeling creative, just use our [Keynote or PowerPoint](https://github.com/jsconf/presentation-templates/downloads) templates.
 * If you need practice giving talks, get in touch. We can hook you up with local groups so you can practice in front of a friendly crowd.

Get in touch: [contact@jsconf.is](mailto:contact@jsconf.is) (just don’t use this to submit a proposal).

If you need more encouragement, check out our great friend Tiffany's site [We Are All Awesome](http://weareallaweso.me/) that aims to convince you to speak at a conference.

## Guidelines

Submit your proposal by **Apr 30th 2016, 23:59:59 GMT**. No excuses. All talks should be **in English**.

**Talks will be 30 minutes.** There is no Q&A. We will be on a tight schedule and will end talks that overrun. We strongly encourage you to time your presentation in advance.

**Keep it snappy**. Proposals should be around two paragraphs.

**No marketing or sales** in your talk. Some of the most interesting talks, however, are born from experiences working on your product.

## Misc

All talks will be recorded and published on the internet for free. We do this for the benefit of those who can’t make it to the conference. If you are in any way uncomfortable, let us know and we will work things out.

Finally, since you retain full ownership of your slides and recording, we’d like to ask you to make your materials and recording available under a creative commons (we default to no commercial reuse) or other open source license.
