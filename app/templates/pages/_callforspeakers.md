> JSConf Iceland: Let's meet in the middle.

We are inviting the JavaScript community to submit talks for the upcoming JSConf Iceland (Thursday and Friday, August 25th and 26th, Reykjavik). This Call for Presentation **closes on August 31st**.

If you think you have something great to talk about, tell us all about it and we consider your entry. If you know someone who has something great to talk about, nominate them.

## Topics

We like to see anything that squarely fits into the spectrum of:

 * Cutting-edge technological advances in the world of JavaScript or computer science in general, if somehow applicable to JavaScript.
 * Wild Ideas & Clever Hacks.
 * Improving JavaScript developers’ lives.
 * Mobile JS.
 * Hardware with JS.
 * Fundamentals, in a modern light.
 * The JavaScript community, culture, history, past, present & future, the why the who and the what of what we’re all doing.
 * And finally: Whatever the hell you want; this is your conference.

## We Can Help

Not everybody is a natural talent on stage. Not everybody can produce kick-ass slide-decks. Not everybody is a live-demo-god. Not everybody knows they have something great to talk about.

There are about a million reasons why *you* don’t consider yourself a speaker. **We are here to prove you wrong**. If all you have is a gut feeling that you should be on stage, we are here to help you to develop or hone the skills you think you lack to deliver a great presentation.

* We are happy to brainstorm your interests to see if a great topic is hiding.
* We are happy to connect you with experienced speakers to help prepare your submission.
* We are happy to review and advise on how to produce a slide deck. If you don't feel creative, just use our [Keynote or PowerPoint](https://github.com/jsconf/presentation-templates/downloads) templates.
 * If you need practice giving talks, get in touch, we can hook you up with local groups or set up a stage for you and a bunch of friends in advance, so you can practice in front of a friendly crowd.
 * Again, *whatever* else you might need, we’re here to help.

Get in touch: [contact@jsconf.is](mailto:contact@jsconf.is) (just don’t use this to submit a proposal).

If you need more encouragement, check out our great friend from JSConf EU Tiffany's site [We Are All Awesome](http://weareallaweso.me/) that tries to convince you to speak.


## The Perks

If you get selected as a speaker at JSConf Iceland, here’s what you get:

 * **Travel to Reykjavik covered.** This usually means we pay for your plane ticket. We are happy to assist with booking your itinerary.

 * **Entrance to the conference.** We won’t be done with the speaker selections by the end of the ticket sales, so if you want to make sure you can attend, you may want to purchase a ticket regardless. If you get selected to speak and if you need to, we can refund your ticket.

 * **We cover your stay in Reykjavik** in a nice hotel near the venue (including free Wifi) for the days of the conference and a day before and after (i.e. August 24th-27th). If you want to stay longer, we can arrange things, just let us know. You will have to cover extra nights, though.

<small>If your employer can cover your travel and hotel, we are happy to list them as an awesome company sponsor. The money we save will be used to make the conference more awesome.</small>

If you have any special requirements, non-return trips (say you are coming from another conference), just let us know, we can usually work these things out.

If you want to bring a significant other, or bring your kid(s) and need child-care to be sorted out for the time of the conference, please also get in touch. We are here to make this easy for you!

## The Selection Process

Here’s roughly how we pick our talks:

 * Anonymize submissions, so we don’t bias against anything related to the submitting person.
 * Two rounds of voting:
   1. The first round rates each talk on a scale from 1 to 10.
   2. The top-N (~50) submissions are rated again on a 3-point scale: “meh”, “yay”, “MUST HAVE”.
 * De-anonymize so we can (finally) bias against speaker details. Based on our budget, we might opt for a local or at least closer-by (read: cheaper to transport) speaker.

…and a number of details that we make up as we go along.


## Guidelines

Submit your proposal by **Apr 31st 2016, 23:59:59 GMT**. No excuses.

All talks are **in English**.

**Talks are usually 30 minutes long** (for longer talks we’d get in touch with you directly). There is no Q&A. We will be on a tight schedule and enforce the end of a talk rigorously. We strongly encourage timing your presentation in advance.

**Make sure you care**, and make sure we see you care. Typos, sloppy formatting and all-lowercase submissions make our reading of your proposal tedious. These things will definitely count against your proposal.

**Don’t overdo it** either. If you need more than two paragraphs to get to the point of your topic, we need to ask you to slim things down.

**No marketing or sales** in your talk. Some of the most interesting talks, however, are born from experiences working on your product.

**Original Topics**. We favour original content. If you want to discuss a topic that you have talked about elsewhere, try to add a twist, or new research, or development, something unique. Of course, if your talk is plain awesome as-is, go for that. :)


## Misc

All talks will be recorded and published on the internet for free, along with a recording of the slide deck, live-demo or other on-presenter-screen activity as well as a transcript and subtitles.

We do this for the benefit of the larger JavaScript community and those who can’t make it to the conference. We hope you want to help out, but if you are in any way uncomfortable, let us know and we will work things out.

Finally, since you retain full ownership of your slides and recording, we’d like to ask you to make your materials and recording available under a creative commons (we default to no commercial reuse) or other open source license.
